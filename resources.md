### Accessing scientific papers

Sometimes it is difficult to get access to papers (such as those among
the [reading assignments](schedule.html)), particularly from home.
Here are strategies I use:

- Search for the paper on [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com).
  Click on "All ___ versions", and you may find an open version of the article.

- Install the [unpaywall browser extension](https://unpaywall.org/products/extension),
  which may help you to find a free version of the article.

- Paste `ezproxy.library.wisc.edu` into the URL for the article.
  You'll get to a page asking for your NetID and password, but this
  could then give you immediate access to the article.

  For example, with the url
  <https://doi.org/10.1198/000313002317572790>, you would instead use
  <http://doi.org.ezproxy.library.wisc.edu/10.1198/000313002317572790>.
  (Note the use of `http` rather than `https`.)

- Try using the [GlobalProtect VPN for
  UW-Madison](https://kb.wisc.edu/helpdesk/page.php?id=68164). Your
  IP addresss might look like you're on campus, and so you might get
  access.

- [Sci-Hub](https://sci-hub.se) provides pirated versions of many
  journal articles, but this is _not_ an accepted way to get access to
  copyrighted material.

- PDFs for this course will be posted on the [Canvas site](https://canvas.wisc.edu)
